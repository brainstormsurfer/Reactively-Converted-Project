# Project Title

Convert HTML/CSS to React Application

## Description

This project involves converting an existing HTML/CSS web page into a React application. The goal is to take an existing static web page, which can be found in the `public` folder, and make it dynamic by building a React-based version while preserving the design and layout. The conversion process has been both challenging and rewarding, resulting in a React application that faithfully replicates the original project.

## Features

- Replicating the existing design and layout using React components.
- Adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web page.
- Creating a routing structure to navigate between different sections or pages.
- Handling data and state management as required.
- Integrating any necessary third-party libraries or packages.
